# HamAudioContext
A simple audio context for audio plugin development for Windows. Uses the XAudio2 backend.

Visit the Project/source directory for the source files. Include "hamaudioctx.h" to use. 

Demo file provided: "test.cpp"

The only issue is memory - not sure how to free all XAudio stuff, let me know if you have experience...
